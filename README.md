# NekoBox
## Description
A game that imitates the famous puzzle game "Sokoban", where the player has to move and push the boxes until all the boxes are in place.

What's more, there are interesting things that have been added to my game: 
* Players can re-start the game at any time by pressing 'R' on the keyboard.
* Players can undo the last operation by pressing 'Z'.
* Custom scene added! ---- Players can self-design their own map, which increases playability a lot.
