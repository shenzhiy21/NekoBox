# NekoBox
## Description
A game that imitates the famous puzzle game "Sokoban", where the player has to move and push the boxes until all the boxes are in place.

What's more, there are interesting things that have been added to my game: 
* Players can re-start the game at any time by pressing `R` on the keyboard.
* Players can undo the last operation by pressing `Z`.
* Custom scene added! ---- Players can self-design their own map, which increases playability a lot.

## Directory Overview
* For those who have no interest in code, download `release` only. After that, enter the game and press `H` on the keyboard to see *Help Menu*, which instructs on how to play the game.
* For those who are willing to look at the code and run it by yourself, download `src` and use Qt-Creator to open it. Remember to delete the file `sokoban-3.pro.user`, or you may get into trouble.
* For those who want to know more, `docs` is an alternative for you, where you can see my ideas and motivations when creating this game. Follow my instruction, and you can easily re-construct the sokoban game by yourself!

## More to Explain
Sokolution, an artificial intelligence for the game, is not included in this repo, because of some unexpected bug after an overall test. However, I have no time to fix the problem now. If you have any idea, feel free to contact me!
